# .NET Membership Committee Meeting

Wednesday, 12 October 2022, 3PM ET

## Meeting Attendees

* Bill Wagner
* Jessica White
* Nicole Miller
* Madison Hardy, Scribe

## Agenda

* **Officer Assignments**
  * The election for Board of Directors has closed. As the three outgoing members depart, the Membership and Outreach Committees will need new chairs. The Board will nominate officers at the upcoming Board meeting (October 27, 2022) and will vote via email to confirm the new chairs. Bill and Jessica discussed who of the three incoming Board members might be interested in holding the positions.
  * The committee briefly discussed the international representation on the Outreach Committee, noting that it is generally North American-central. Bill added that the fastest growing countries for .NET adoption are India, Brazil, and China which is interesting as no Board member or committee chair represents those communities. Bill and Jessica discussed reaching out to members of the community to gain momentum.
* **VMX transition**
  * Bill asked for a status update for the membership portal. Nicole reported that she had asked the VMX representative for access but hadn't received a response. Madison and Eric Schneider will follow up; Nicole will announce the transition in the newsletter when the portal opens.

## Next Steps / Action Items

* Madison to coordinate VMX update with Eric S.
* Nicole to prep newsletter announcement for VMX.

**The meeting adjourned at 3:09PM ET**
