# The .NET Foundation Membership Committee

The committee is responsible for evaluating new member applications and discussing membership criteria. [See more information on .NET Foundation Committees here](https://dotnetfoundation.org/community/committees)

## Details

**Chairperson(s):** [Jessica White](https://github.com/wordshaker)

**Meets:** 1st and 3rd Wednesday of each month at 7:00pm UTC

**Repository:** https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-membership

## Governance

The meeting notes are available [here](meetings).

This committee seeks to have a diverse set of representatives from various stakeholders. At the same time, we try to keep the committee somewhat small so that we can have productive meetings. But in order to satisfy the desire for open participation from everyone – and in the sake of transparency – we made this repo public, which includes notes and proposals that documents the progress of the committee. If you have any questions, please open a discussion.
